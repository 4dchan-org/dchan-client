          <strong>Q: What is this?</strong>
          <div>
            This is <DchanNetwork />, a decentralized time-traveling imageboard.

        </div>

        <div className="pb-2">
          <strong>Q: ...Decentralized?</strong>
          <div>
            <DchanNetwork /> is a Web3 imageboard whose posts and images are
            respectively stored on <Polygon />
            's blockchain and on IPFS, using <TheGraph /> to index and serve the
            content in a decentralized manner.

          <div>
            <DchanNetwork />
            's backend was built using <TheGraph />, which is capable of
            obtaining data as it was at any point in time, allowing you to read{" "}
            <DchanNetwork />
            's content exactly as it was whenever in the past. This also means
            that there is no need for an archive, as it is already built in the
            protocol. Use the ‚è≥ button in the header to try it out!

        </div>

        <div className="pb-2">
          <strong>Q: ...Imageboard?</strong>
          <div>
            <DchanNetwork /> is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone
            can post comments, share images and create boards. It is heavily
            inspired by 4chan.
          </div>

        <div className="pb-2">
          <strong>Q: Is it free?</strong>
          <div>
            Kind of. 
            <br />
            You will need a crypto wallet to post and some <Polygon />{" "}
            to pay the TX fee to post.
            <br />
            At the time of writing this FAQ (August 2022) TX fees for a post is
            around ~$0.001 per post, so $10 worth of MATIC would allow you to
            post ~10000 times, although it is possible that fees will be higher during
            high on-chain activity.
            <br />
            You can get some free <Polygon /> at the following faucets:
            <div>
              <Faucets />
            </div>
            Or you can simply buy it from whatever exchange trades it.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="pb-2">
          <strong>Q: Is it uncensorable?</strong>
          <div>
            Kind of.
            <br />
            While the content is stored on decentralized services (<Polygon />{" "}
            and IPFS), the way it's served (as of now) does have some
            centralization to it and can therefore be censored.
            <br />
            As previously said, posts are stored on the blockchain; more
            specifically, every single action that alters the website state,
            such as posting, board creations, moderator actions, etc ... is stored publicly on the
            blockchain.
            <br />
            Those actions are then parsed by <TheGraph />
            's indexers, a decentralized network of nodes whose job is to run a
            program (called "subgraph") which defines how to handle those raw
            actions and how to "index" them into a format usable by the{" "}
            <DchanNetwork /> client, and then serve that content.
            <br />
            But that subgraph, as well the client served by <DchanNetwork />,
            and the server it is served from, and the domain that points to that
            server ... are all controlled by <DchanNetwork />
            's owner, me.
            <br />
            That means I have total control over what <DchanNetwork />
            's users can and cannot see, so it's fully possible for me to censor
            content, change the rules as I please, ban whoever I like for
            whatever reason I fancy, shut down the website, and whatever else I
            deem necessary to protect myself and <DchanNetwork />
            's users from malicious actors.
            <br />
            <i>HOWEVER.</i>
            <br />
            That doesn't mean I can alter or delete the content itself.
            Remember, the blockchain cannot be changed and images are stored on
            IPFS, out of my reach.
            <br />
            Thus, while I can arbitrarily choose to avoid displaying content on
            my own website, it's fairly trivial for anyone to deploy a version
            of the subgraph/client/website to display that content, regardless of
            my decisions and actions.
            <br />
            (Also worth noting that, in the event that none of <TheGraph />
            's indexers will be willing to serve the subgraph via the
            decentralized network, it will still be possible to run a subgraph
            node and retrieve the content in a centralized manner.)

        <div className="pb-2">
          <strong>Q: Are posts anonymous?</strong>
          <div>
            No. Or rather, they are as anonymous as the address they're posted
            from.
            <br />
            Due to the public nature of the blockchain, posts are directly tied
            to whoever signed the post, meaning that{" "}

          <div>
            Too bad.
            <br />
            Once you post on the blockchain, it's forever.
            <br />
            You cannot delete it.
